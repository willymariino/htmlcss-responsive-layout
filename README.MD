# Responsive Layout Project

Live demo in **Italian**: [Giallo Booleano](https://giallobooleano-tiramisu.netlify.app/)

## Overview
This is one of my first responsive web design exercises, initially developed with HTML and CSS, then enhanced with JavaScript. The goal was to explore breakpoints and layout behavior across devices.

## Features
**Responsive Design**: Adapts to common device widths:
- Desktop ≥ 992px
- Tablet 768–991px
- Mobile ≤ 480px
- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic structure, responsive grid, media queries
- **JavaScript**: Adds reading time estimation and updates on scroll

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

##  How It Works
- HTML sections define page structure
- CSS applies adaptive styles using media queries
- JS tracks scroll to show estimated reading time left

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – main structure
- `style.css` – responsive layout rules
- `script.js` – interaction logic
- `assets/` – images and icons

## Educational Purpose
Practiced:
- Layout scalability with media queries
- Clean structure and visual hierarchy
- Enhancing UX with scroll-based interactions

## Breakpoints Used
| Device      | Width Range     |
|-------------|------------------|
| Desktop     | ≥ 992px         |
| Tablet      | 768px–991px     |
| Mobile      | ≤ 480px         |

##  Improvements To Consider
- Add dark mode
- Localize text (toggle EN/IT)
- Improve accessibility (a11y)
