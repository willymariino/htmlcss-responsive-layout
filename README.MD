# Responsive Layout Project

## Overview
This project was one of my first exercises, initially focused on HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on responsive design across various breakpoints. Later, JavaScript functionality was added to enhance the interactivity of the page. The primary goal was to learn and implement responsive web design principles.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to three main breakpoints:
  - **Desktop**: 992px and above.
  - **Tablet**: 768px to 991px.
  - **Mobile**: 480px and below.
- **HTML and CSS**: Structured content and styled components with a focus on responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Added functionality to estimate reading time and dynamically update the remaining reading time as the user scrolls.

## Educational Purpose
The project was created as part of a learning journey to understand:
- How to use media queries to create responsive layouts.
- Best practices for structuring HTML and CSS for scalability.
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript to improve user experience.

## How It Works
1. **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page, including sections for images, text, and social media links.
2. **CSS**: Implements styling and responsiveness using media queries for different screen sizes.
3. **JavaScript**: Calculates and displays the estimated reading time based on the content length and updates it dynamically as the user scrolls.

## Breakpoints
- **Desktop (≥992px)**: Optimized for larger screens with additional spacing and layout adjustments.
- **Tablet (768px–991px)**: Adjusted font sizes and layout for medium-sized screens.
- **Mobile (≤480px)**: Simplified layout for smaller screens with a focus on usability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
